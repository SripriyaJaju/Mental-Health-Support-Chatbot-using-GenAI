# Mental-Health-Support-Chatbot-using-GenAI
Developed a CBT-based mental health chatbot by fine-tuning the Gemma 3 4B model using the Unsloth framework and CACTUS dataset. Applied LoRA-based tuning, custom chat templates, and evaluated with BLEU, ROUGE-L, and perplexity. Deployed via Gradio with real-time monitoring using WandB.
